# Quick Run and Debug Buttons - README

## Features

Adds two buttons to the editor toolbar: a Green/Debug button and a Start/Gray button.

You can configure what each button does in VSCode settings:

- Debug
- Run
- Hide Button

You need to select a launch option from the "Run and Debug" section in the Activity Bar (Ctrl/CMD + Shift + D)!

... And that's it.

**Enjoy!**
