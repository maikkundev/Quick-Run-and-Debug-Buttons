# Quick Run and Debug Buttons - README

## Features

Adds two buttons to the editor toolbar: a Debug button (Green Arrow) and a Start without Debug button.

The Debug button starts debugging your project.
The Start button launches your project without debugging.

You need to select a launch option from the "Run and Debug" section in the Activity Bar (CTRL + SHIFT + D / CMD + SHIFT + D)!

... And that's it.

**Enjoy!**
